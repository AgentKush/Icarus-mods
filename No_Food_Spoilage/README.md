**Version:** 1.2  
**Author:** AgentKush  
**Compatible with:** JimK72's Icarus Mod Manager (EXMODZ format)

## Description

Prevents all food items and volatile substances from spoiling in Icarus.

## Features

- **No Spoilage**: Meat, fish, vegetables, milk, cream, and volatile substances last forever
- **Composter Recipes**: Manually convert raw meats into Spoiled Meat for fertilizer production

## Composter Recipes Added

Since food no longer spoils naturally, you need a way to produce Spoiled Meat for the composter. These recipes let you intentionally spoil raw meats when needed:

| Raw Meat | Spoiled Meat |
| Raw Fish | Spoiled Meat |
| Raw Chicken | Spoiled Meat |
| Raw Bacon | Spoiled Meat |
| Gamey Meat | Spoiled Meat |
| Soft Meat | Spoiled Meat |
| Stringy Meat | Spoiled Meat |
| White Meat | Spoiled Meat |
