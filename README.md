## 🎒 Agent's Items KITS `v5.0` ⭐ NEW!

> **30 consumable kits that SURVIVE the dropship landing!**

This version organizes all 1,500+ items into **30 category-based kits**. Buy a kit, land on the planet, consume it, and receive all items in that category!

### Why Kits?
The original Agent's Items mod added items directly to the Workshop, but those items would disappear during dropship landing (they lacked the `Item.Meta` tag that vanilla Workshop items have). **The Kit system fixes this!**

### Available Kits:

| Category | Items | Category | Items |
|:---------|:-----:|:---------|:-----:|
| 🪨 Raw Resources | 91 | 🧪 Processed Materials | 50 |
| 🌱 Seeds & Farming | 33 | 🪓 Stone/Bone Tools | 19 |
| ⚒️ Metal Tools | 80 | 🏹 Ranged Weapons | 41 |
| 🔫 Firearms & Ammo | 45 | 🥋 Basic Armor | 30 |
| 🛡️ Advanced Armor | 41 | 🐻 Creature Armor | 53 |
| 🥩 Raw Food | 18 | 🍳 Cooked Food | 93 |
| 💊 Medicine | 24 | ⚙️ Attachments | 81 |
| 🛡️ Shields & Defense | 24 | 📦 Containers | 32 |
| 🔨 Benches | 44 | ⚡ Machines & Power | 53 |
| 💡 Lighting | 55 | 🪵 Building (Wood) | 53 |
| 🧱 Building (Stone) | 53 | 🔩 Building (Metal) | 43 |
| 🪑 Rustic Furniture | 37 | 🛋️ Modern Furniture | 48 |
| 🖼️ Decorations | 51 | 🏆 Trophies & Heads | 192 |
| 🐾 Animals & Pets | 69 | 🎣 Fishing | 28 |
| 🔧 Utility Tools | 16 | 🪤 Traps | 4 |

### How to Use:
1. Research & purchase kits at the Workshop (in "Agents Items" tab)
2. Load kits into your dropship loadout
3. Land on the planet - **kits survive!** 
4. Use/consume the kit from your inventory
5. All items from that kit are added to your inventory!
