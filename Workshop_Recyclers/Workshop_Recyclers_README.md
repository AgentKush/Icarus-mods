> **Two new dedicated recycling machines for workshop items!**

This mod adds cloned versions of the Biofuel Bio-Cleaner and Organic Residue Cleanser, 
repurposed specifically for recycling workshop items into currency.

## 🔧 New Machines

| Machine | Model Based On | Crafted At |
|:--------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Biofuel Recycler** | Biofuel Bio-Cleaner | Fabricator |
| **Organic Residue Recycler** | Organic Residue Cleanser | Fabricator |

Both machines use the same 3D models as their original counterparts but have their own 
dedicated recipe lists containing only recycling recipes.

## 📦 How It Works

1. **Unlock in Tech Tree** (Tier 4)
2. **Craft at Fabricator**
3. **Deploy the recycler**
4. **Put workshop items in** → Get Ren / Exotics / Red Exotics out
5. **Use Orbital Exchange Interface** to send currency to orbit

## ✨ Why Use Dedicated Recyclers?

- **Clean separation** - Original cleaners keep their normal recipes
- **No clutter** - Recycling recipes only appear in recyclers
- **Same models** - Familiar look, new purpose
- **Balanced** - Must craft the recycler first, no free currency exploit

## ⚠️ Testing Needed
